TWITTER ANALYSIS DASHBOARD
This project showcases a Twitter Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI. The goal of this dashboard is to provide in-depth insights into tweet data, focusing on engagement metrics, impressions, media views, and user interactions through clicks. The dashboard includes various interactive visualizations and features, enabling the exploration of tweet performance from different angles.

Key Features
Pie Chart: Purpose: This pie chart visualizes the proportion of total clicks, which includes URL clicks, user profile clicks, and hashtag clicks for tweets that have more than 500 impressions. Drill-Down Feature: A drill-down option is available, allowing users to dive deeper and view specific types of clicks for each tweet. This enables a detailed understanding of the click distribution per tweet.
Clustered Bar Chart: Purpose: The clustered bar chart breaks down the sum of URL clicks, profile clicks, and hashtag clicks by tweet category. The tweet categories analyzed include: Tweets with media content. Tweets with links. Tweets containing hashtags.
Filters Applied:
Only includes tweets with at least one interaction type (URL clicks, profile clicks, or hashtag clicks). Only considers tweets posted between 3 PM and 6 PM. The tweet's posting date must be an even-numbered day. The tweet's word count must be below 40 words. 3. Line Chart: Purpose: The line chart displays the trend of the average engagement rate over the course of the year. The chart is split into two lines: One line representing tweets with media content. Another line representing tweets without media content.

Filters Applied:
Only includes tweets where the engagement rate is an even number. Only includes tweets posted on an odd-numbered day. Only considers tweets posted between 3 PM and 6 PM.

Tasks Implemented
Created Power BI Visualizations: Developed the visualizations (Pie Chart, Clustered Bar Chart, and Line Chart) and applied the necessary filters and drill-down features to ensure accurate and dynamic data exploration.

Power BI Template Export: Exported the Power BI template, which can be reused or modified for future projects. The template retains all the visualizations and applied filters for easy access and customization.

Hosting on Netlify: The completed project has been deployed and hosted on Netlify/Vercel to make the dashboard accessible through a live web link. The hosted version allows anyone to interact with the dashboard without needing Power BI.

Responsive Design: Ensured that the website and dashboard are fully responsive and optimized for all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. The responsive design ensures that the dashboard is user-friendly, regardless of the screen size.

Tools Used
Power BI: Power BI was used to create the visualizations and the dashboard. It allows for data analysis, visualization, and the application of filters and drill-down capabilities to explore tweet data in detail.

Netlify: Netlify was used to deploy and host the live version of the project. These platforms allow for seamless deployment, providing a publicly accessible URL where users can interact with the dashboard.

GitHub: GitHub is used for version control, storing the project files, and making it easy for others to collaborate or explore the repository.
